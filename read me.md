Don't know what to eat?  Use this app to help!

Our app will ask permission to use the camera on your device.  You allow this to happen.

Then you will take a snapshot of your face from the video streaming from the camera. 

This snapshot will be sent to the face++ api which will return the emotion you have expressed. 

Based on the emotion displayed, you will be asked if this is correct. 

If this is correct, you will be provided with a list of food places based on your emotion. 

From this list of food places, google maps will show the location of each place.
